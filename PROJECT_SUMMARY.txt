CAR PRICES DATASET - COMPLETE DATA CLEANING & ANALYSIS SUMMARY
===================================================================================
Project Completion Date: January 28, 2026
Dataset: Car auction sales data (558,837 initial records)

===================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
===================================================================================

This project involved comprehensive cleaning, enrichment, and analysis of a large
car auction dataset. Through multiple stages of data quality improvement, we 
achieved 99% data completeness and removed 5,736 corrupted records, resulting in
a final dataset of 553,101 high-quality records ready for analysis and modeling.

===================================================================================
DATA CLEANING PROCESS - STAGES
===================================================================================

STAGE 1: INITIAL NULL VALUE HANDLING
--------------------------------------
Approach: Statistical imputation for numeric and categorical fields
Method:
  - Numeric fields (odometer, mmr, sellingprice): Median imputation
  - Categorical fields (make, model, transmission, etc.): Mode imputation
  
Results:
  - Addressed initial missing values across 13 columns
  - No records removed at this stage
  - Created baseline cleaned dataset

STAGE 2: VIN DECODING & ENRICHMENT  
-----------------------------------
Approach: Extract vehicle information from 17-character VINs
Method:
  - Analyzed VIN structure (World Manufacturer Identifier, year codes, etc.)
  - Built lookup tables from existing data (548,510 records with valid VINs)
  - Mapped VIN codes to missing make/model values
  
Results:
  - Filled 10,300 missing make values (99.99% recovery rate)
  - Filled 10,377 missing model values (99.79% recovery rate)
  - Added 5 new VIN-derived features for analysis
  - Year validation: 99.99% consistency between VIN and year field

STAGE 3: FINAL NULL HANDLING
-----------------------------
Approach: Domain-specific strategies for remaining nulls

Transmission Field:
  - Method: Mode imputation (most common value)
  - Value used: "automatic" (85.16% of dataset)
  - Records filled: 65,352
  - Rationale: Realistic for US car market where automatic dominates

Condition Field:
  - Method: Stratified mean by year
  - Records filled: 11,820
  - Rationale: Vehicle condition correlates strongly with age
  - Calculated separate means for each year (1982-2015)
  - Example: 2015 cars avg condition = 41.5, 1982 cars = 3.0

State Field:
  - Method: Validation against official US state codes
  - Valid codes: 50 states + DC + 6 territories = 56 codes
  - Invalid entries found: 30 codes (Canadian provinces, corrupted VINs)
  - Created dimension table with 34 states represented

STAGE 4: CORRUPTED RECORD REMOVAL
----------------------------------
Criteria for removal:
  - Missing critical fields (year, make, model, sellingprice, VIN)
  - Invalid state codes (non-US states, corrupted data)
  
Results:
  - Records removed: 5,736 (1.03% of dataset)
  - Breakdown:
    * Missing critical fields: 38 records
    * Invalid state codes: 5,702 records (Canadian provinces, corrupt data)
  
Examples of removed records:
  - Cars with state codes "QC" (Quebec), "AB" (Alberta), "ON" (Ontario)
  - Records with VINs in state field (data corruption)
